# DEFINITIONS  
## 1 Preliminary Notions 
concept: 	an intensionally defined term specific to an academic discipline definition: the necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in a unit description: a compilation of the variable attributes of an individual case or set of cases 
extensional definition: the necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in a unit rendered by enumeration of the members or a statistical summary of same 
generalization: 	a statistical summary of the attributes of a given set of phenomena hypothesis: a proposed explanation for a specific set of things or events 
ideational: 	anything which does not have objective existence 
intensional definition: the necessary and sufficient conditions for membership rendered as a set of distinctive features which an object or event must display to be a member method: a sub-system of theory which is directed toward the solution of a particular class of problem 
phenomenological: 	anything which has an objective existence 
principle (law): 	a theoretical statement of a relationship held to obtain between two or more classes 
science: 	a systematic study deriving from a logical system which results in the ordering of phenomena to which it is applied in such a manner as to make them ahistorical and capable of explanation (obviously defined to emphasize the role of formal theory) systematics: the procedures for the creation of sets of units derived from a logical system for a specified purpose technique: the application of a particular method to a given set of phenomena . 
theory: 	a system of units (classes) and relationships (laws) between units that provides the basis for the explanation of phenomena 

2 
analysis (analytic step): the discrimination of attributes within a stipulated field and the selection of criteria from such 
attributes arbitrary: 	not inherent in nature as a sole solution 
arrangement: 	any activity which produces ordered sets of units attribute: the smallest qualitatively distinct unit discriminated for a field of phenomena in a given investigation class: an intensionally defined unit of meaning classification: the creation of units of meaning by means of stipulating redundancies.
denotatum: a	ny actual instance (thing or event) assigned to a specific class; the means of indicating that an object has been designated as a member of a class grouping: the creation of units of phenomena identification: the process of sorting phenomena in terms of class _significata_ with the purpose of assigning them to specific classes _significatum_: the necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in a class, an intensional definition of a class 
## 3 Kinds of Classification 
dimension: 		a set of mutually exclusive alternative features 
index: 	a unidimensional classification herein treated as a special-case paradigm 
paradigmatic classification: dimensional classification in which classes are formed by intersection 
root: 	the field of paradigmatic classification expressed as a feature common to all classes in such a classification 
taxonomic classification: non-dimensional classification in which classes are defined by means of intersection 
## 4 Non-Classificatory Arrangement 
coefficient of similarity: a numerical expression of the number of features in which two objects or events agree (no scale implied: object may be attribute, discrete object, and so on) 
group: a	n aggregate of actual objects or events, either physically or conceptually associated as a unit (no scale implied) 
grouping device: 	any method for the delineation of units which makes use of quantitative characteristics of a particular set of phenomena to produce units with the characteristics of groups 
identification devices: any forma structure designed to assign events or objects to previously defined classes numerical taxonomy: a grouping device which utilizes similarity of constituent pairs to delimit units 
similarity: 	a quantitative assessment of the number of features shared by two or more objects or events (no scale implied) statistical clustering: methods of grouping which employ the frequency of association to delineate units 
## 5 Prehistory 
artifact: 	anything which exhibits any physical attributes that can be assumed to be the results of human activity culture: a concept referring to shared ideas used as an explanatory device prehistory: the science of artifacts and relations between artifacts conducted in terms of culture 
## 6 Classification in Prehistory 
data: 	phenomena categorized for use by a specific science horizon: a cultural class which displays an extensive distribution in space and a restricted distribution in time (horizon-style is applied when the classes are at the scale of attribute) level: a set of units (classes) which display the same or comparable degree of inclusiveness or rank 
mode: 	(analytic) an intuitive cultural class of attributes of discrete objects; (synthetic) a cultural paradigmatic class of attributes of discrete objects 
occupation: 	a spatial cluster of discrete objects which can reasonably be assumed to be the product of a single group of people at a particular locality and deposited there over a period of continuous residence, comparable to other such units in the same study 
phase: 	(synthetic) a paradigmatic class of occupations defined by types and/or modes 
scale: 	a set of objects (group) which display the same degree of inclusiveness or rank 
tradition: 	a cultural class which displays an extensive distribution in time and a limited distribution in space 
type: (analytic) 	an intuitive cultural class of discrete objects; (synthetic) a paradigmatic class of discrete objects defined by modes
