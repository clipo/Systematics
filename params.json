{"name":"Systematics","tagline":"Systematics in Prehistory: Second Edition","body":"### Welcome Systematics in Prehistory: The Second Edition.\r\n\r\n_Systematics in Prehistory_ was originally written and published by Robert C. Dunnell in 1971, 42 years ago. Despite its age the book remains one of the most useful tools for understanding how knowledge of about prehistory is generated. While most contemporary North American archaeologists remain largely and willfully ignorant of unit issues, the book has a broad following globally: anywhere archaeologists struggle to understand the *nouns* of the discipline and wish to wrestle scientific meaning from our observations. \r\n\r\nThough the book is timeless in its implications many of the details are woefully out of date.  Worse, there are parts of the book that less-than-clear in the prose or due to the lack of concrete examples.  Here, we (Carl Lipo, Mark Madsen, Tim Hunt) seek to update _Systematics_ and hopefully to clarify issues for a new generation of archaeologists. We hope to make this edition richer in terms of the examples and to update the text with more current references and expanded discussions. \r\n\r\nGiven the recognition that evolutionary theory is the appropriate explanatory theory for the science of prehistory, there is a temptation to make this book deeply connected to evolutionary thought and analyses.  We hope to avoid that to some degree in order to keep the book's central emphasis on the requirements of science at the heart of its analysis. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
